# gge 1.10 ()

* Remove `gge.formula()`.


# gge 1.9 (2024.10.28)

* Documentation pages now created via Github Actions.

* Changed vignette chunk option `eval=0` to `eval=FALSE` to maybe fix error when `revdep`-checking `agridat`.

* Fixed vignette example showing the difference between genotype-focused and environment-focused biplots.


# gge 1.8 (2023-08-20)

* Switch from GPL3 to MIT license.

* Fix docType issue as requested by CRAN.


# gge 1.7 (2021-10-31)

* Remove LazyData from DESCRIPTION.


# gge 1.6 (2020-12-16)

Brian Ripley wrote: "The future of OpenGL is uncertain (except on macOS, where it has no future).  So it seems reasonable to require `rgl` only when essential to the package.  These packages have it in Depends/Imports but seem not to actually call it in their checks (established using a fake install).  It is possible that the sole purpose of the package might be to do interactive visualizations which are not checked, but that seems not to be the case here.  We noticed calls to rgl functions in \dontrun{}, but they would better be conditioned by if(interactive()) (see 'Writing R Extensions'). Please move rgl to Suggests and use conditionally (see ยง1.1.3.1 of 'Writing R Extensions') at the next package update.""

* Moved rgl to Suggests. Cannot use `require(rgl)` because that crashes R for some users, so use `if("rgl" %in% installed.packages() )` to check for installation and then call functions `rgl::open3d()`


# gge 1.5 (2020-07-21)

* Please use `gge(data,formula)` instead of `gge(formula,data)`.

* New argument `ggb=TRUE` to request construction of GGB biplot.


# gge 1.4 (2018-05-15)

* Use `cex.gen=0` to omit genotype names.

* On some Windows machines, `library(rgl)` crashes R, perhaps because of a dll conflict with Windows. Removed `@import rgl` so that `rgl` is not loaded by default, and now `biplot3d` uses calls like `rgl::text3d`.


# gge 1.3 (2017-12-14)

* The `nipals()` function using C++ code has been removed.

* The `rnipals()` function has been removed.

* The `gge` package now imports the `nipals` package, which is new.


# gge 1.2 - (2017-05-26)

* New function `nipals()` for finding principal components using C++.  Code from `pcaMethods` package.

* New function `rnipals()` for finding principal components in R.

* New function `biplot3d()` to draw 3d biplots using `rgl` package.

* Modifed `main`, `subtitle`, `xlab`, `ylab` arguments to allow removal.

* Changed `title` argument to `main` for consistency with other packages.

* Now using `testthat` and `covr` packages.

* Added package logo on GitHub.


# gge 1.1 (2016-10-08)

* Added `zoom.gen` and `zoom.env` arguments to `biplot()` for  M.Zoric.

* Moved tests to `tests/gge_tests.R`


# gge 1.0 (2015-12-14)

* Package `gge` is split off from `agridat` package.

* Added `origin`, `hull` arguments to `biplot()`.


# gge 0.1 - (2013-01-01)

* Added `gge()` to agridat package.


# gge 0.0 - (2004-01-01)

* Created function `gge()` to fit and plot GGE biplots.


## A history of NIPALS functions in gge

1. (2007) Created `nipals()` based on `pcaMethods::nipalsPca()`.  Modified the function for faster execution and submitted a patch back to `pcaMethods`.

2. (2010) Henning Redestig created a C++ version of NIPALS for the `pcaMethods` package.

3. (2017) The `gge::nipals()` R function is re-named `rnipals()`, and a new `nipals()` function is created, based on the C++ code in `pcaMethods`. Released gge version 1.2.

4. (2017) Discovered that `mixOmics::nipals()` is a pure R function that is faster than the C++ version, so `gge::nipals()` was re-written into a pure R function. The C++ version was removed from the `gge` package. 

5. (2017) The `gge::nipals` function is moved to a new package, `nipals::nipals`. The function is optimized for performance, improved to better handle missing values and to orthogonalize the principal components.
